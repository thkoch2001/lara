** crates to use

- https://crates.io/crates/anyhow - Flexible concrete Error type built on std::error::Error
- https://github.com/utkarshkukreti/select.rs - extract data from HTML
*** robots.txt

Google based [[https://crates.io/crates/robotstxt][robotstxt]] does not(?) provide an object to hold a parsed
robots.txt, is from a time before [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9309/][RFC 9309]] and seems to be very "unrusty"
(much mutable global state). After all it's a simple transliteration from C++.
